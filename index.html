                  I am currently holding the role of Principal Solutions
                  Architect within Constellation NewEnergy's Operations
                  department. I am tasked with writing requirements, acting as a
                  median from the business to the development team, and creating
                  department specific tools to allow for improved efficiencies.
                  While most of my work related tools revolve around Microsoft
                  applications, in some free time outside of work, I have
                  continued to explore additional languages outside of my web
                  development knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am
                  currently expanding my python related skills by working
                  through various coding challenges.

                <p>
                  I am a University of Wisconsin-Green Bay graduate, obtaining a
                  Bachelor of Science in Economics. For the past 8 years I have
                  held various roles within Constellation NewEnergy, spanning
                  from Account Management, Volume Management, to my current role
                  as a Solutions Architect. Within Account Management my focus
                  was held by managing customer relationships for large volume
                  accounts. Within Volume Management I was tasked with
                  forecasting customer loads and managing storage totaling more
                  than 4 BCF. I have continued education with a certificate in
                  Full Stack Web Development from the University of Wisconsin
                  Extended Campus.

                <p>
                  I have enjoyed the challenges and learning that goes along
                  with coding. I have been accepted into Rutgers University to
                  obtain a Masters in Data Science and look forward to the
                  opportunity to begin the program in the future. I look forward
                  to the opportunities of expanding into many other languages to
                  further my coding growth. Professionally I continue to gain
                  knowledge and experience to one day find myself in more of a
                  Data Analyst or potentially a Data Scientist role.
